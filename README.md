# D2DX

D2DX is a project for running classic Diablo II/LoD on modern PCs, with enhancements that honor the original look and feel. Play in a window or in fullscreen, glitch-free, with (or without) enhancements like widescreen and anti-aliasing.

Version 0.99.430

## Mission statement
  - Turn the game into a well behaved DirectX 11 title on Windows 10 (7, 8 and 8.1 are also supported).
  - High quality scaling to modern resolutions, including widescreen.
  - Aim to preserve the classic Diablo 2/LoD experience as much as possible.
  
## Implemented
  - High performance DirectX 11 renderer (Glide wrapper).
  - Proper gamma/contrast.
  - Improved fullscreen mode: instant ALT-TAB and low latency.
  - Improved windowed mode.
  - Widescreen support (in vanilla D2/LoD).
  - Anti-aliasing of specific jagged edges in the game (sprites, walls, some floors).
  - Seamless windowed/fullscreen switching with (ALT-Enter).
  - Fixes various glitches in the supported game versions.

## Upcoming
  - Smooth out the experience. (hint)
  - Suggestions welcome!

## Requirements
  - Diablo 2: LoD (see Compatibility section below).
  - Windows 7 SP1 and above (10 recommended for latency improvements).
  - A CPU with SSE2 support.
  - Integrated graphics or discrete GPU with DirectX 10.1 support.

## Compatibility
Game versions supported:
  - All features: 1.12, 1.13c and 1.13d.
  - All features except widescreen: 1.09d, 1.10 and 1.14d.
  - Other versions are unsupported, will display a warning at startup and exhibit glitches.

D2DX has been tested working with the following mods:
  - MedianXL (1024x768)
  - PlugY
  - D2ModMaker

## Installation
  Copy the included "glide3x.dll" into your Diablo II folder.
  
  Note that in some cases you may have to also download and install the Visual C++ runtime library from Microsoft: https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x86.exe

  The wrapper should work with PlugY, just make sure you have (at a minimum) -3dfx in the ini file:
  ```
  [LAUNCHING]
  Param=-3dfx
  ```

## Usage
### To start the game with D2DX enabled
  ```
  Game.exe -3dfx
  ```
Windowed/fullscreen mode can be switched at any time by pressing ALT-Enter.

### Command-line options

  Note: more information about these can be found in the Wiki.

  Disable mouse cursor clipping
  ```
  -dxnoclipcursor
  ```

  Hide the "D2DX" logo on the title screen
  ```
  -dxnologo
  ``` 
  
  Disable widescreen mode
  ```
  -dxnowide 
  ```

  Disable built-in resolution mod entirely
  ```
  -dxnoresmod
  ```

  Disable FPS fix
  ```
  -dxnofpsfix
  ```
  
  Disable v-sync (may be useful on G-Sync/FreeSync displays)
  ```
  -dxnovsync
  ```
  
  Disable anti-aliasing
  ```
  -dxnoaa
  ```
  
  In window mode, keeps window in upper-left corner
  ```
  -dxnowindowmove
  ```
  
  In windowed mode, scale the size by 2 or 3:
  ```
  -dxscale2
  -dxscale3
  ```

### Experimental motion prediction mode

  See the Wiki page on Motion Prediction.


### Experimental widescreen (windowed and fullscreen) modes 
  PLEASE NOTE: This only works with 1.12, 1.13c and 1.13d at this time.

  D2DX contains a modified version of D2HD to provide widescreen in-game modes.

  Widescreen mode is enabled by default, except if:
  - The option -dxnowide is passed.
  - Running a game version that isn't supported.
  - Running the "Median XL" mod (D2DX will allow it to use 1024x768 instead).

  D2DX will create a file named "d2dx_d2hd.mpq" in the Diablo II folder, and add a new in-game resolution, close to the normal ones but having the aspect ratio of your monitor.
  The goal of this is to achieve proper fullscreen scaling without artifacts when displaying the game on modern PCs.

  - For a 1920x1080 monitor, this is 960x540 (in fullscreen: 2x integer scaling).
  - For a 2560Ã—1440 monitor, this is 1280x720 (in fullscreen: 2x integer scaling).
  - For a 3840x2160 monitor, this is 1280x720 (in fullscreen: 3x integer scaling).

## Troubleshooting

### I get a message box saying "Diablo II is unable to proceed. Unsupported graphics mode."
  You are running the download version of Diablo II from blizzard.com. This can be modified to work with D2DX (Wiki page about this to come).

### It's ugly/slow/buggy.
  Let me know by filing an issue! I'd like to keep improving D2DX (within the scope of the project).

## Third-party libraries
This project uses the following third party libraries:
- FNV1a hash reference implementation, which is in the public domain.
- Detours by Microsoft.
- SlashDiablo-HD/D2HD by Mir Drualga and Bartosz Jankowski, licensed under Affero GPL v3.
- FXAA implementation by Timothy Lottes. (This software contains source code provided by NVIDIA Corporation.)

## Release history

### 0.99.430
  - Add experimental motion prediction ("smooth movement") feature. This gives actual in-game fps above 25. It is a work in progress, see
    the Wiki page (https://github.com/bolrog/d2dx/wiki/Motion-Prediction) for info on how to enable it.

### 0.99.429
  - Fix AA being applied on merc portraits, and on text (again).

### 0.99.428
  - Fix AA sometimes being applied to the interior of text.

### 0.99.423b
  - Fix high CPU usage.
  - Improve caching.
  - Remove registry fix (no longer needed).
  - Updated: Fix AA being applied to some UI elements (it should not).
  - Updated: Fix d2dx logo.

### 0.99.422
  - Fix missing stars in Arcane Sanctuary.
  - Fix AA behind some transparent effects, e.g. character behind aura fx.
  - Add -dxnocompatmodefix command line option (can be used in cases where other mods require XP compat mode).

### 0.99.419
  - Fix issue where "tooltip" didn't pop up immediately after placing an item in the inventory.
  - Add support for cfg file (named d2dx.cfg, should contain cmdline args including '-').
  - Further limit where AA can possibly be applied (only on relevant edges in-game and exclude UI surfaces).
  - Performance optimizations.

### 0.99.415
  - Add fps fix that greatly smoothes out frame pacing and mouse cursor movement. Can be disabled with -dxnofpsfix.
  - Improve color precision a bit on devices that support 10 bits per channel (this is not HDR, just reduces precision loss from in-game lighting/gamma).
  - To improve bug reports, a log file (d2dx_log.txt) will be written to the Diablo II folder.

### 0.99.414
  - The mouse cursor is now confined to the game window by default. Disable with -dxnoclipcursor.
  - Finish AA implementation, giving improved quality.
  - Reverted behavior: the mouse cursor will now "jump" when opening inventory like in the unmodded game. This avoids the character suddenly changing movement direction if holding LMB while opening the inventory.
  - Fix issue where D2DX was not able to turn off XP (etc) compatibility mode.
  - Fix issue where D2DX used the DX 10.1 feature level by default even on better GPUs.
  - Fix misc bugs.

### 0.99.413
  - Turn off XP compatibility mode for the game executables. It is not necessary with D2DX and causes issues like graphics corruption.
  - Fix initial window size erroneously being 640x480 during intro FMVs.

### 0.99.412
  - Added (tasteful) FXAA, which is enabled by default since it looked so nice. (It doesn't destroy any detail.)

### 0.99.411
  - D2DX should now work on DirectX 10/10.1 graphics cards.

### 0.99.410
  - Improved non-integer scaling quality, using "anti-aliased nearest" sampling (similar to sharp-bilinear).
  - Specifying -dxnowide will now select a custom screen mode that gives integer scaling, but with ~4:3 aspect ratio.
  - Added -dxnoresmod option, which turns off the built-in SlashDiablo-HD (no custom resolutions).
  - (For res mod authors) Tuned configurator API to disable the built-in SlashDiablo-HD automatically when used.
  - Other internal improvements.

### 0.99.408
  - Fix window size being squashed vertically after alt-entering from fullscreen mode.
  - Fix crash when running on Windows 7.

### 0.99.407
  - For widescreen mode, select 720p rather than 480p in-game resolution on 1440p monitors. 

### 0.99.406
  - Fix bug that could crash the game in the Video Options menu.

### 0.99.405
  - Simplify installation by removing the need to copy SlashDiablo-HD/D2HD DLL and MPQ files.
    Only glide3x.dll needs to be copied to the Diablo II folder.

### 0.99.403b
  - Fix mouse sensitivy being wrong in the horizontal direction in widescreen mode.
  - Fix bug occasionally causing visual corruption when many things were on screen.
  - Fix the well-known issue of the '5' character looking like a '6'. (Shouldn't interfere with other mods.)
  - Fix "tearing" seen due to vsync being disabled. Re-enable vsync by default (use -dxnovsync to disable it).
  - Some small performance improvements.
  - Updated: include the relevant license texts.

### 0.99.402
  - Add seamless alt-enter switching between windowed and fullscreen modes.

### 0.99.401c
  - Add experimental support for widescreen modes using a fork of SlashDiablo-HD by Mir Drualga and Bartosz Jankowski.
  - Remove the use of "AA bilinear" filtering, in favor of point filtering. This is part of a work in progress and will be tweaked further.
  - Cut VRAM footprint by 75% and reduce performance overhead.
  - Source code is now in the git.
  - Updated: fix occasional glitches due to the wrong texture cache policy being used.
  - Updated again: forgot to include SlashDiabloHD.mpq, which is required. 

### 0.99.329b
